Prompt at https://gemini.google.com/

# **Fundamental Principles**

## 1. **Specificity Over Generality**

-Vague: "a nice portrait"

-Better: "hyper-realistic studio portrait with professional lighting"

## **2. Visual Hierarchy**

-Start with the main subject

-Add environment/background

-Specify lighting and mood

-Include technical details

## 3. **Professional Photography Language**

-Use camera terminology (85mm lens, f/1.4, shallow depth of field)

-Reference lighting setups (Rembrandt lighting, studio lighting)

-Mention photography styles (editorial, cinematic, fine art)

# **What Makes a Prompt Effective**

A well-structured prompt typically includes:

-**Subject Description** (who/what)

-**Pose/Action** (body language, positioning)

-**Environment** (background, setting)

-**Lighting** (type, direction, mood)

-**Style** (aesthetic, genre)

-**Technical Specifications** (camera settings, composition)

-**Mood/Atmosphere** (emotional tone)

## Example 1: Professional Branding Portrait

Prompt Used:

Hyper-realistic full-body portrait of the uploaded photo, standing casually against a smooth light-gray wall. The outfit is as worn as in winter. The hands are inside the pockets, the left hand wears a square smartwatch, one leg casually crossed over the other, relaxed and confident posture. The lighting is a professional studio, bright yet soft, premium clarity.
On the wall beside him is a bold black-and-white stylized vector portrait of the same subject, rendered with modern geometric accents. Beneath the graphic, add clean bold text 'Zain' in large type, and below it is a smaller font 'AI DEVELOPER'

Mood & Style: modern, minimalistic, premium personal-branding aesthetic, sharp contrast, sleek composition.

✅ What Worked Here

Subject grounding: “of the uploaded photo” ensures consistency.

Pose instructions: “hands inside the pockets, leg casually crossed” avoids random posture.

Context & setting: “smooth light-gray wall, professional studio lighting” makes it brand-safe.

Extra elements: vector portrait + typography = personal brand identity.

💡 Takeaway Rule: For branding prompts, combine subject grounding + posture + context + design elements (like logos or text).



##  Example 2: Corporate Shoot:

focus on the face, natural skin tones, minimal retouching, LinkedIn profile photo style.

## Example#03: Digital Aesthetic:

# **Simple Tips for Making Better Images**

## **Focus on the Person**

Always use the phrase: “of the uploaded photo.” This helps the AI make sure the person in the new image looks exactly like the person in the picture you provided.

## **Set the Scene**

Describe the surroundings. Tell the AI what should be in the background, what the walls look like, how the lights are set up, and what objects should be in the room.

## **Choose a Style and Vibe**

Pick a specific look for your image. You can ask for styles like a professional office look, a movie scene, high-end art, or a high-tech future.

## **Use Camera Tricks**

Mentioning camera parts like an 85mm lens will make the photo look more realistic. You can also describe the light—use words like "soft light" or "backlight" to change the feeling of 

the image.

## **Add Your Brand**

You can tell the AI to include things like company logos, words on top of the image, or modern shapes and patterns.

## **Build Step by Step**

Don't try to do everything at once. Start with a simple idea (like "business photo"), then slowly add details about the person's pose, the objects around them, and any text you want to 

see.


# **VIDEO GENERATION**

AI video generation is the process of creating videos using artificial intelligence. The AI can turn text, images, or ideas into videos automatically without manual filming or editing.

If you write “a cat running in a park” and the computer creates a short video of it, that is called AI video generation.

## Core Principles:

A well-structured prompt typically includes:

Camera Movement/Angle (establishing the shot)
Subject Description (who/what is in frame)
Action/Movement (what's happening)
Environment/Setting (where it takes place)
Lighting/Atmosphere (mood and visual tone)
Audio Elements (dialogue, sound effects, ambient)
Technical Style (film format, color grading)
Duration Pacing (how action unfolds over time)

**EXAMPLE # 01** (Educational Content)

PROMPT:

Prompt:

Medium shot of enthusiastic teacher at whiteboard explaining complex diagram with animated gestures. Camera holds steady as teacher moves naturally within frame. Modern classroom with soft natural lighting from large windows. "The key concept here is understanding the relationship between these elements," spoken with clarity and passion. Background ambient sound of classroom atmosphere. Clean, documentary style with accurate color reproduction. Educational content aesthetic with clear audio.

💡 Use Case: Perfect for online courses, tutorials, or educational marketing content.
